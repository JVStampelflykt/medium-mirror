    <h2>1. The Refused Voice of a Minor</h2>
    <p>In June 2025, my daughter Mariia Verkhovych submitted two independent legal complaints to the Förvaltningsrätten i Härnösand, concerning denial of subsistence payments (dagersättning) and a retroactive housing debt imposed under an undocumented status. Both filings were legally formulated, signed, and referenced child protection principles under the Barnkonventionen (UNCRC incorporated in Swedish law).</p>
    <p>The court failed to issue separate case numbers or confirm registration.</p>
    <p>A formal follow-up request was submitted on 12 July 2025 demanding a statement on the status of these filings. As of this writing, no answer has been received.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/ZH62W9VSN8#bltpv5gUhdsO"> Pending legal request for formal court stance — 12 Jul 2025</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/AH4S5DAKT4#EaIYsksVCAu6"> Original filing 1</a> AND <a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/VE0XGV7YH4#JPVEtLEp618U">Original filing 2</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is not only a procedural lapse. It is a complete administrative silence toward a minor, whose legal standing is explicitly protected under Swedish law.</p>

    <h2>2. A Rejected Lawsuit — Redirected to the Opponent</h2>
    <p>My own administrative lawsuit, filed on 6 May 2025, challenged the non-consensual assignment of temporary protection status under Directive 2001/55/EC. I argued that I had applied for asylum, not temporary protection, and that the reassignment deprived me and my family of basic rights — including medical care, social benefits, and legal aid.</p>
    <p>The filing was initially forwarded by the court to Migrationsverket, the authority I was challenging, without my consent and without opening a case.</p>
    <p>Only after a formal protest and legal clarification was the case properly registered. It was then summarily dismissed, with the court claiming lack of jurisdiction.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The subject of the case was not a migration issue, but an administrative reassignment of legal status.</li>
      <li>The court itself marked the file as case “1861–25E”, where the “E” stands for an administrative (not migration) case.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>➤ <a href="https://drive.proton.me/urls/YYHGQETXCM#oHfsy25lrTgx">Initial complaint, formal protest on irregular redirect and Rejection decision — June 2025</a></p>

    <h2>3. The Chancellor of Justice: A Closed Channel</h2>
    <p>In parallel, I submitted four separate complaints to the Justitiekanslern (Chancellor of Justice) in May 2025, detailing violations of legal procedure, status reassignment, and a retroactive debt issued to a family with no income and no contract.</p>
    <p>The reply from JK was a blanket refusal, citing no competence to intervene.</p>

    <p>Following that, I submitted three follow-up communications with clarifications and additional documentation. As of mid-July 2025, no further response has been received, despite formal delivery and legal validity.</p>

    <h2>4. DG HOME: 'Even Swedish Courts Have Raised Concerns'</h2>
    <p>(pending CJEU case C­195/25 — request for a preliminary ruling from a Swedish court)</p>
    <p>In July 2025, the European Commission (DG HOME) responded to our earlier complaint with a statement that included the following striking observation:</p>
    <blockquote>“Several courts in Sweden appear to have raised questions about the application of the Directive and national implementation procedures.”</blockquote>
    <p>While the Commission stopped short of conclusions, the fact that Swedish courts themselves have begun to question the legal basis of temporary protection assignments adds significant weight to our experience.</p>

    <p>
    These documented failures — in the courts, at the Chancellor level, and in all channels of domestic protection — not only compelled the family to bring their case before the European Court of Human Rights, but also began drawing external attention.

    <p>
    The situation has already attracted attention from an independent editorial platform, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Radical Politics</span>, which published a detailed

    <h2>5. Submission to the European Court of Human Rights</h2>
    <p>In early July 2025, our family submitted a formal application to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing violations of Articles 3, 6, 8, 13 and Protocol 1 of the Convention. The core of the case lies in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The imposed legal status without informed consent or right to appeal;</li>
      <li>The denial of all forms of assistance, including subsistence and medical aid, despite fulfilling all eligibility criteria;</li>
      <li>The refusal of legal protection, both through courts and the Chancellor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The case includes 266 pages of documentation, and a full demonstration of exhaustion of domestic remedies, now rendered unavailable through silence, redirection, and rejection.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: A Legal Wall Against a Family</h2>
    <p>Sweden prides itself on the rule of law. But what happens when a family of six, including a newborn, is administratively isolated — cut off from financial assistance, standard medical care, and legal remedies — and no institution accepts responsibility?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Courts do not register a child’s legal filings?</li>
      <li>Complaints are redirected to the authority being challenged?</li>
      <li>The Chancellor refuses to act?</li>
      <li>And the European Commission hints that even the judiciary is unsure?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite having paid over SEK 640,000 in taxes, our family has been denied unemployment benefits, child allowances, standard medical aid, and parental leave. We are now entering the fourth month without any state support, under a status never requested by us, and only after the asylum process was unlawfully dismissed.</p>
    <p>This substitution of legal basis resulted in a forced shift in rights and entitlements, causing irreversible consequences for a vulnerable family with four children.</p>
    <strong>Is this still the legal order the EU promises to protect?</strong>

    <h2>Acknowledgment</h2>
    <p>Special thanks to Johannes Wilm, editor of the independent platform <a href="https://radicalpolitics.org/">Radikal Politikk</a>, for being the first to recognize the broader significance of our case and to offer us a voice when silence seemed inevitable.</p>
    <p>Despite all our efforts to document and communicate the reality of our situation, it was his decision to publish our story — thoughtfully and courageously — that prevented it from becoming just another unspoken tragedy, quietly erased from public view.</p>
