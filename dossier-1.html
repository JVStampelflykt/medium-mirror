<p>Introduction</p>
<p>I am Yevhenii Verkhovych, father of four children, currently residing in Sweden. This document presents a factual record of our official correspondence with the Swedish Ombudsman for Children (Barnombudsmannen). It specifically concerns communications submitted on behalf of two of my children: Lev Verkhovych (2 month old) and Mariia Verkhovych (16 year old).</p>
<p>Despite the age and vulnerability of the individuals involved, the responses from the institution — if any — did not address the substance of the documented concerns.</p>
<p>We publish only facts, without interpretation or judgment. The materials are presented to ensure transparency and enable independent assessment by journalists, legal experts, and institutional observers.</p>
<p>We remain open to dialogue.</p>
<p>This is only a fraction of the documented material, which is available for review by journalists, lawyers, or human rights actors upon request.</p>
<p>A full archive of referenced files, in their original PDF form, is available here: 🔗</p>
<p>Section I: Correspondence Regarding Lev Verkhovych (Age 2 Months)</p>
<p>📆 6 May 2025</p>
<p>📩 Incoming email from BO.
Subject: The Swedish Ombudsman for Children (Barnombudsmannen) confirmed receipt but stated it does not handle individual cases, conduct supervision, or review other authorities’ decisions. The response referred the complainant to the Parliamentary Ombudsman (JO) and provided general information links. No assessment or acknowledgement of the legal concerns raised was offered.</p>

<p>📆 3 May 2025</p>
<p>📩 Outgoing email to BO.
Subject: A formal complaint was submitted to the Swedish Ombudsman for Children (Barnombudsmannen) on behalf of Lev Verkhovych (born February 2025), a 2-month-old infant. The letter reports that he and his three underage siblings each received individually addressed debt letters from Migrationsverket, stating their father owed 6,300 SEK. The infant was named as a direct recipient. The complaint argues this constitutes a systematic practice of addressing legal demands to children, including infants, without regard for legal capacity, age, or procedural safeguards. It raises questions about the legality of such actions under Swedish law and international child rights instruments. The request seeks institutional review of compliance with Articles 3, 12, and 13 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>

<p>Section II: Correspondence Regarding Mariia Verkhovych (Age 16)</p>
<p>📆 7 May 2025</p>
<p>📩 Incoming email from BO.
Subject: The response from the Swedish Child Rights Bureau (Barnrättsbyrån) was a referral. The organization did not engage with the substance of the inquiry concerning the legal and psychosocial impact of an involuntarily assigned protection status under Directive 2001/55/EC. Instead, the sender was redirected to external legal aid organizations. No child rights analysis was provided.</p>

<p>📆 6 May 2025</p>
<p>📩 Outgoing/Incoming emails BO.
Subject: Request (6 May 2025):
A 16-year-old applicant, Mariia Verkhovych, submitted a written statement to the Swedish Ombudsman for Children (Barnombudsmannen), outlining violations of child rights due to the involuntary assignment of temporary protection status. The letter cited specific consequences: denial of financial and educational rights, retroactive rent demands, and lack of asylum case assessment. The sender requested an institutional view from a child rights perspective.</p>
<p>Response (6 May 2025):
The Ombudsman replied that responsibility for asylum legislation lies with the government and parliament, and referred the applicant to external organizations (Asylrättscentrum, JO). No substantive assessment of the case or legal opinion was provided.

Subject: Letter from a 16-year Mariia describing how involuntary temporary protection status under Directive 2001/55/EC led to the denial of asylum review, loss of financial support, education rights, and housing security — with a request for assessment from a child rights perspective.</p>

<p>📆 3 May 2025</p>
<p>📩 Outgoing email to BO.
Subject: Mariia Verkhovych (age 16) submitted a detailed letter to the Swedish Ombudsman for Children (Barnombudsmannen), stating that she was denied asylum solely on the basis of being involuntarily assigned temporary protection under Directive 2001/55/EC — a status she and her guardians never applied for or consented to. She emphasized that her asylum interview was conducted in full, yet disregarded. She also reported denial of financial support and a retroactive rent demand addressed to her as a child. The letter concludes with specific legal questions about the lawfulness of assigning such status without consent and using it to reject a child’s asylum claim.</p>

Subject: Request (23 April 2025):
Mariia Verkhovych (age 16) submitted a written statement to the Swedish Ombudsman for Children (Barnombudsmannen), reporting rights violations affecting herself and her three underage siblings due to involuntary assignment of temporary protection status. She requested institutional attention to the broader, potentially systemic nature of the issue.</p>
<p>Response (23 April 2025):
The Ombudsman replied that it does not handle individual cases or exercise supervisory authority. The applicant was referred to external legal aid organizations. No assessment or acknowledgment of the described systemic or child rights implications was provided.</p>

Subject: Mariia Verkhovych (age 16) contacted the Swedish Ombudsman for Children (Barnombudsmannen) to report that she receives no financial support (dagersättning) from Migrationsverket despite having no income of her own. She attached a formal appeal submitted to the Förvaltningsrätten and described receiving housing debt notifications addressed to her as a child. She questioned whether it is acceptable to treat children in this manner under Swedish law and requested that the Ombudsman review the case.</p>
