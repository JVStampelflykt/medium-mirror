<p>I am Yevhenii Verkhovych, a Ukrainian national and father of four children. I previously worked with international organizations such as the United Nations country office in Ukraine and the International Committee of the Red Cross. My role involved developing ICT infrastructure and supporting field operations.</p>
<p>My family and I arrived in Sweden on March 22, 2022. At the time, we had three children; our fourth was born in Sweden in February 2025. Until recently, I was employed in Sweden in senior software development roles with companies such as Capgemini and TietoEvry.</p>

<p>letters was addressed to a newborn child — one month old at the time. The decision denies daily support (dagersättning) without specifying any future date of review. It is based on the family’s previous income, with no indication of the current financial situation or source of subsistence. The letter implies a financial liability tied to the parent, but no formal invoice or contract is attached to support this.</p>

<p>📩 Outgoing email to JO (14 April 2025):
Supplement referring to the Uppsala municipality case, where retroactive rent demands were withdrawn after public criticism. The sender reports receiving a similar retroactive invoice from Migrationsverket (67,410 SEK) without prior agreement, shortly after job loss.

<p>P.S. Lessons for Other Refugee Families</p>
<p>This record is individual, but certain patterns observed during the process may be relevant for others. The following points are not legal advice, but practical observations from the course of official communication:</p>
<p>Authorities may assign a legal status (e.g., temporary protection) without an explicit request or signed application.
In some cases, this assignment limits access to rights that would have otherwise applied under other legal frameworks.</p>
<p>Retroactive financial demands can be issued without prior contracts or agreements.
These demands may be framed as obligations, even when no formal rental agreement or amount was ever discussed or signed.</p>
<p>Letters concerning financial obligations may be sent to minors, including newborns.
These letters often reference debts attributed to the parent, without clear legal basis or supporting invoices.</p>
<p>Court submissions may be forwarded by administrative courts to the opposing authority before formal registration.
This can occur without notifying the sender, raising concerns about the integrity of the legal process.</p>
<p>Requests for state support (e.g., daily allowances) may be denied based on prior income, with no assessment of current needs.
In some instances, no date for re-evaluation is provided, and assumptions are made that a family will remain self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Responses from oversight institutions may take the form of procedural closure without comment on the substance.
Even detailed complaints with documentation may be closed without investigation or reasoning.</p>
<p>These points are based solely on documented exchanges and may not reflect broader policies or outcomes in other cases.</p>
