<p id="adb3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">By J.V. St&auml;mpelflykt<br />May 2025</p>
<p id="0244" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Sweden is known for its strong legal tradition and commitment to human rights. But what happens when individuals &mdash; including children &mdash; seek protection and answers, only to encounter silence?</p>
<p id="4138" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">This article does not accuse. It documents.</p>
<p id="dadd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Based on direct correspondence with Sweden&rsquo;s key oversight and advocacy bodies &mdash; including the&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">Parliamentary Ombudsman (JO)</strong>, the&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">Child Ombudsman (Barnombudsmannen)</strong>,&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">Civil Rights Defenders</strong>,&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">FARR</strong>,&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">Amnesty Sweden</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">Barnr&auml;ttsbyr&aring;n</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; this article examines how well the institutional system functions when it is asked to respond to concrete, fact-based reports of harm.</p>
<h1 id="0224" class="mz na gg bf nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">When Children Write and No One Reads</h1>
<p id="1031" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me nx mg mh mi ny mk ml mm nz mo mp mq oa ms mt mu ob mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">In early May 2025, formal complaints were submitted to the Swedish Ombudsman for Children on behalf of two minors: a&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">newborn infant</strong>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">16-year-old girl</strong>. Both described systemic harm &mdash; legal documents and financial claims addressed directly to children, retroactive rent demands without contracts, and the denial of basic rights following the involuntary assignment of temporary protection status.</p>
<p id="487c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The responses:</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="f6c9" class="ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my oc od oe bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The infant received a procedural note saying the Ombudsman does not handle individual cases.</li>
<li id="3e03" class="ma mb gg md b me of mg mh mi og mk ml mm oh mo mp mq oi ms mt mu oj mw mx my oc od oe bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The 16-year-old was advised to contact unrelated external organizations.</li>
</ul>
<p id="75c9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Neither response acknowledged the core concern: that the law may be systematically bypassed when applied to vulnerable children. No child rights analysis was offered.</p>
<h1 id="c0e5" class="mz na gg bf nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Parliamentary Oversight &mdash; Without Oversight</h1>
<p id="d387" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me nx mg mh mi ny mk ml mm nz mo mp mq oa ms mt mu ob mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The Swedish Parliamentary Ombudsman (<strong class="md gh">JO</strong>) received extensive documentation:</p>
<ul class="">
<li id="bbd2" class="ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my oc od oe bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Letters addressed to minors demanding payment of parental debts.</li>
<li id="e130" class="ma mb gg md b me of mg mh mi og mk ml mm oh mo mp mq oi ms mt mu oj mw mx my oc od oe bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">A&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">67,410 SEK invoice</strong>&nbsp;issued after the family lost its sole source of income.</li>
<li id="0276" class="ma mb gg md b me of mg mh mi og mk ml mm oh mo mp mq oi ms mt mu oj mw mx my oc od oe bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Denials of asylum and support based on a protection status the family never applied for.</li>
<li id="ffa2" class="ma mb gg md b me of mg mh mi og mk ml mm oh mo mp mq oi ms mt mu oj mw mx my oc od oe bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Evidence of tax contributions totalling over&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">648,000 SEK</strong>&nbsp;over three years, with no benefits in return.</li>
</ul>
<p id="ea0a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The final reply from JO? The case was closed&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">without investigation</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="ca94" class="mz na gg bf nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Civil Rights Defenders: A Partial Exception</h1>
<p id="87ca" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me nx mg mh mi ny mk ml mm nz mo mp mq oa ms mt mu ob mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Among all institutions contacted,&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">Civil Rights Defenders (CRD)</strong>&nbsp;offered the most thorough response. Their legal team reviewed the material, cited relevant Swedish laws (&sect;13&ndash;15 of the LMA), acknowledged the weight of the retroactive rent claim, and noted the complexity of the situation.</p>
<p id="4c0d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">However, CRD ultimately&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">declined</strong>&nbsp;to offer direct support, citing limited capacity.</p>
<p id="d522" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Recognition &mdash; but no resolution.</p>
<h1 id="c750" class="mz na gg bf nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Amnesty Sweden: Structurally Absent</h1>
<p id="900f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me nx mg mh mi ny mk ml mm nz mo mp mq oa ms mt mu ob mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">In May 2025,&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">Amnesty International Sweden</strong>&nbsp;confirmed that it no longer handles individual cases due to internal restructuring. They referred the sender to Asylr&auml;ttscentrum and the Red Cross &mdash; the same institutions other ombudsmen had already redirected to.</p>
<p id="e437" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">No opinion on the documented harm was provided. The case &mdash; involving newborns receiving debt letters &mdash; remained unaddressed.</p>
<h1 id="72a0" class="mz na gg bf nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Barnr&auml;ttsbyr&aring;n: Child Rights Without Analysis</h1>
<p id="4a3e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me nx mg mh mi ny mk ml mm nz mo mp mq oa ms mt mu ob mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="md gh">Barnr&auml;ttsbyr&aring;n</strong>, an organization that describes itself as focused on children&rsquo;s rights, responded without any legal engagement. Their message: contact someone else.</p>
<p id="81c3" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">They did not examine whether it is lawful to deny a 16-year-old both asylum consideration and financial support. They did not question the practice of addressing debt notifications to minors. And they did not comment on the psychological toll of long asylum interviews that led to nothing.</p>
<p id="0666" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">No analysis. No position. Just a referral.</p>

<p id="3e1c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me nx mg mh mi ny mk ml mm nz mo mp mq oa ms mt mu ob mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="md gh">FARR (Flyktinggruppernas Riksr&aring;d)</strong>&nbsp;&mdash; a national network claiming to defend refugee rights &mdash; was among the first organizations contacted. The request was specific: assess possible systemic violations, including a retroactive rent invoice issued after income loss, denied benefits, and financial threats sent to children.</p>
<p id="776f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The response began with a request for location. Then came a redirection to various volunteer groups across the region. But when pressed for actual legal assistance,&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">FARR explicitly proposed that the family, despite having no income, should consider hiring private lawyers &mdash; at their own expense</strong>.</p>
<p id="f92c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">This recommendation was made despite FARR having full knowledge of the family&rsquo;s vulnerable financial status, including the presence of a newborn child and the complete withdrawal of state support.</p>
<p id="4d6e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph=""><em class="mc">&ldquo;We could suggest some lawyers we know are good,&rdquo; they wrote.&nbsp;</em><strong class="md gh"><em class="mc">&ldquo;But they are private and must be paid.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p id="f923" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">No legal opinion was given. No statement of concern was made. No engagement occurred &mdash; even when a documented, systematic, and potentially unlawful targeting of children was presented in full detail.</p>
<p id="9de9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Instead of defending rights, the network&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">offered a market solution.</strong></p>
<h1 id="643f" class="mz na gg bf nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">A Pattern Emerges</h1>
<p id="3b95" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me nx mg mh mi ny mk ml mm nz mo mp mq oa ms mt mu ob mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">When multiple institutions &mdash; both governmental and NGO &mdash; receive structured legal submissions and respond&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">not with contradiction but with redirection</strong>, a troubling pattern forms.</p>
<p id="8058" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is not that the case was dismissed as baseless. It was that&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">no one engaged</strong>.</p>
<p id="fcf4" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">No legal errors were cited. No factual corrections were offered. But no action was taken.</p>
<p id="80a7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">Each body acknowledged &mdash; but none assumed responsibility.</p>
<h1 id="d9de" class="mz na gg bf nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">What This Tells Us</h1>
<p id="dd9a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me nx mg mh mi ny mk ml mm nz mo mp mq oa ms mt mu ob mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">The experience suggests a larger institutional fatigue or evasion. The system &mdash; when faced with a case too complex, too sensitive, or too revealing &mdash;&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">refers it away</strong>.</p>
<p id="785c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the language of bureaucracy,&nbsp;<strong class="md gh">referral is a soft rejection</strong>. And when this happens consistently, it becomes a systemic signal: there is no one to escalate to.</p>
<p id="53d5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph ma mb gg md b me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my fo bk" data-selectable-paragraph="">No oversight. No redress. No answer.</p>
